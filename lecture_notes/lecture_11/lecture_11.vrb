\frametitle {Frequency}
To get the frequency spectrum of the data you are analyzing, do the following (in Matlab) :
\ \\
\begin{verbatim}
Fs = 150;    sampling frequency
t = 0:1/Fs:1;    discretized time domain
f = 5;    frequency of our sin wave
y = sin(2*pi*f*t);
nfft = 1024;    length of the fft domain, power of 2
x = fft(y,nfft);
x = abs(x(1:nfft/2)); Half of the data, fft is symmetric
f = (0:nfft/2-1)*Fs/nfft;    frequency vector
\end{verbatim}
