# computational_math
Introduction course to computational methematics. Code written in Matlab, pdf slides included.

## Outline

Slides are label and briefly cover the material for the week. Matlab code is stored in the code folder. Follow the syllabus to 
get a more detailed view of the course outline. In general the course covers the following in order: 

-Introduction to matlab.
-Using control squences in Matlab. 
-Numerical differentiation, solving linear systems.
-Numerical integration, error classification. 
-Runge-kutta methods. 
-Local truncation error, global error, and norms. 
-Modeling physical systems: the pendulum.
-Modeling physical systems: populations and epidemiology. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
-Approximating functions with series, truncation error.
-Periodic functions and fourier series, discrete fourier transform.
-FFT using real data.
